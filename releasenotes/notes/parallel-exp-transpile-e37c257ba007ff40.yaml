    The component experiment circuits of :class:`.ParallelExperiment` are
    now explicitly transpiled using that component experiments
    :meth:`~.BaseExperiment.transpile_options` before being combined into
    the circuits returned by :meth:`.ParallelExperiment.circuits`. 
    Any transpile options set on the Parallel Experiment will then be
    applied to the transpilation of these combined circuits before
    execution on a backend.
