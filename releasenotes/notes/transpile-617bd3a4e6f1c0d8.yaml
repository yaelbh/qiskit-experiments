features:
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.BaseExperiment._transpiled_circuit` method which can be
    overloaded to customize circuit transpilation behavior of
    :class:`.BaseExperiment` subclasses.
deprecations:
  - |
    :meth:`BaseExperiment._postprocess_transpiled_circuits` has been deprecated.
    The new :meth:`BaseExperiment._transpiled_circuits` should be overloaded
    instead to implement post-transpilation circuit processing in
    :class:`.BaseExperiment` subclasses.
upgrade:
  - |
    The component experiment circuits of :class:`.ParallelExperiment` are
    :class:`.BatchExperiment` are now explicitly transpiled using that component
    experiments :meth:`~.BaseExperiment.transpile_options` before being combined
    into the composite experiment circuits.
    Any transpile options set on the Parallel or Batch Experiment will then be
    applied to the transpilation of these combined circuits before
    execution on a backend.
